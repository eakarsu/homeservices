Complete Marketing Strategy for Your Field Service Software

  ---
  Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

  1. Create Your Marketing Assets

  | Asset               | Purpose                               |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------------|
  | Landing page        | Clear value prop, pricing, signup     |
  | Comparison pages    | "vs ServiceTitan", "vs Housecall Pro" |
  | Demo video          | 2-3 min product walkthrough           |
  | Case study template | For early customers                   |
  | Pricing page        | Transparent, no "contact sales"       |

  2. Define Your Positioning

  Target message:
  "The AI-powered field service platform that gives you ServiceTitan features at 1/10th the price. No per-technician fees. No contracts.
  Cancel anytime."

  Key differentiators to emphasize:
  - Flat pricing (not per-technician)
  - AI features included (not expensive add-ons)
  - No contracts, cancel anytime
  - Setup in hours, not weeks
  - Transparent pricing on website

  Where Contractors Actually Hang Out

  |----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|

  Content Strategy for Forums

  DO:

  [value first]. By the way, I'm working on an affordable alternative to the big platforms if anyone's interested in trying it."
