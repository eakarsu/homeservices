  My Recommendations

  If you want highest margin + fastest growth:

  → Healthcare AI (ambient scribes, prior auth, medical coding)

  If you want lower barrier + clear ROI:

  → Legal Tech (contract analysis, document review)

  If you want to leverage your current expertise:

  → Stay in Home Services but add AI-native features competitors don't have (voice AI, predictive diagnostics, agentic scheduling)

  Wildcard high-growth:

  → Enterprise AI Agents (workflow automation copilots)

  Would you like me to explore any specific sector further or help you evaluate which one aligns best with your skills and resources?
